# Power-plant-maintenance-scheduling-problem-by-Simulated-Annealing-and-Hill-Climbing-algorithms
This project focuses on the optimization problem. And the purpose of this project is to schedule the maintenance of power plant production units using Simulated Annealing and Hill Climbing algorithms. In this way, in each defined time interval the amount of energy stored in the energy production system must be maximum.
## An example of program output:
### In this bar chart, the x-axis shows the intervals and the y-axis shows the energy value.

Green color: minimum energy produced  
Orange color: stored energy  
Gray color: energy of units under repair

### In this line chart, the x-axis shows the frequency of program generations and the y-axis represents the minimum amount of energy stored in each execution.
